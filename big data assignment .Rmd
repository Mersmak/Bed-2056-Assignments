What is the proportion of boys to girls?
```{r}
# filter for boys 
NatM <-  filter(Nat2017, sex =="M")
count(NatM)
# 1 976 014 boys 


# Filter for girls 
NatF <- filter(Nat2017, sex =="F")
count(NatF)
# 1 885 707 girls


# Proportion boys to girls  
count(NatM)/count(NatF)
# 1.04789
```

Average birth weight 
```{r}
mean(Nat2017$weight)
# 3262,134 grams 
```

Make a density plot on the birth weight between boys and girls. Is it different?
```{r}
# Simple density plot between the two sexes 
ggplot(Nat2017, aes(x = weight, color = sex)) +
  geom_density()

# More advanced densityplot with mean weight at birth

# Mean of each group
library(plyr)
mu <- ddply(Nat2017, "sex", summarise, grp.mean=mean(weight))

# Defining the plot
p <- ggplot(Nat2017, aes(x = weight, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4)

# Add mean lines and print the plot 
p + geom_vline(data = mu, aes(xintercept=grp.mean, color = sex),
             linetype="dashed")
# The density is different as we can see. But not by much.
```

Does the average birth weight vary by month?
```{r}

# The total difference beetween the highest and lowest month is only 17,144 grams so i would conclude that there is not much of a difference.
